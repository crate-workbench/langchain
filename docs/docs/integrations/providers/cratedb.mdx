# CrateDB

This documentation section shows how to use the CrateDB vector store
functionality around [`FLOAT_VECTOR`] and [`KNN_MATCH`]. You will learn
how to use it for similarity search and other purposes.


## What is CrateDB?

[CrateDB] is an open-source, distributed, and scalable SQL analytics database
for storing and analyzing massive amounts of data in near real-time, even with
complex queries. It is PostgreSQL-compatible, based on [Lucene], and inherits
the shared-nothing distribution layer of [Elasticsearch].

It provides a distributed, multi-tenant-capable relational database and search
engine with HTTP and PostgreSQL interfaces, and schema-free objects. It supports
sharding, partitioning, and replication out of the box.

CrateDB enables you to efficiently store billions of records, and terabytes of
data, and query it using SQL.

- Provides a standards-based SQL interface for querying relational data, nested
  documents, geospatial constraints, and vector embeddings at the same time.
- Improves your operations by storing time-series data, relational metadata,
  and vector embeddings within a single database.
- Builds upon approved technologies from Lucene and Elasticsearch.


## CrateDB Cloud

- Offers on-demand CrateDB clusters without operational overhead, 
  with enterprise-grade features and [ISO 27001] certification.
- The entrypoint to [CrateDB Cloud] is the [CrateDB Cloud Console].
- Crate.io offers a free tier via [CrateDB Cloud CRFREE].
- To get started, [sign up] to CrateDB Cloud, deploy a database cluster,
  and follow the upcoming instructions.


## Features

The CrateDB adapter supports the _Vector Store_, _Document Loader_,
and _Conversational Memory_ subsystems of LangChain.

### Vector Store

`CrateDBVectorSearch` is an API wrapper around CrateDB's `FLOAT_VECTOR` type
and the corresponding `KNN_MATCH` function, based on SQLAlchemy and CrateDB's
SQLAlchemy dialect. It provides an interface to store and retrieve floating
point vectors, and to conduct similarity searches.

Supports:
- Approximate nearest neighbor search.
- Euclidean distance.

### Document Loader

`CrateDBLoader` provides loading documents from a database table by an SQL
query expression or an SQLAlchemy selectable instance.

### Conversational Memory

`CrateDBChatMessageHistory` uses CrateDB to manage conversation history.


## Installation and Setup

There are multiple ways to get started with CrateDB.

### Install CrateDB on your local machine

You can [download CrateDB], or use the [OCI image] to run CrateDB on Docker or Podman.
Note that this is not recommended for production use.

```shell
docker run --rm -it --name=cratedb --publish=4200:4200 --publish=5432:5432 \
    --env=CRATE_HEAP_SIZE=4g crate/crate:nightly \
    -Cdiscovery.type=single-node
```

### Deploy a cluster on CrateDB Cloud

[CrateDB Cloud] is a managed CrateDB service. Sign up for a [free trial].

### Install Client

```bash
pip install crash langchain langchain-openai sqlalchemy-cratedb
```


## Usage » Vector Store

For a more detailed walkthrough of the `CrateDBVectorSearch` wrapper, there is also
a corresponding [Jupyter notebook](/docs/extras/integrations/vectorstores/cratedb.html).

### Provide input data
The example uses the canonical `state_of_the_union.txt`.
```shell
wget https://github.com/langchain-ai/langchain/raw/v0.0.325/docs/docs/modules/state_of_the_union.txt
```

### Set environment variables
Use a valid OpenAI API key and SQL connection string. This one fits a local instance of CrateDB.
```shell
export OPENAI_API_KEY=foobar
export CRATEDB_CONNECTION_STRING=crate://crate@localhost
```

### Example

Load and index documents, and invoke query.
```python
from langchain.document_loaders import UnstructuredURLLoader
from langchain.embeddings.openai import OpenAIEmbeddings
from langchain.text_splitter import CharacterTextSplitter
from langchain.vectorstores import CrateDBVectorSearch


def main():
  # Load the document, split it into chunks, embed each chunk and load it into the vector store.
  raw_documents = UnstructuredURLLoader("https://github.com/langchain-ai/langchain/raw/v0.0.325/docs/docs/modules/state_of_the_union.txt").load()
  text_splitter = CharacterTextSplitter(chunk_size=1000, chunk_overlap=0)
  documents = text_splitter.split_documents(raw_documents)
  db = CrateDBVectorSearch.from_documents(documents, OpenAIEmbeddings())

  query = "What did the president say about Ketanji Brown Jackson"
  docs = db.similarity_search(query)
  print(docs[0].page_content)


if __name__ == "__main__":
  main()
```


## Usage » Document Loader

For a more detailed walkthrough of the `CrateDBLoader`, there is also a corresponding
[Jupyter notebook](/docs/extras/integrations/document_loaders/cratedb.html).


### Provide input data
```shell
wget https://github.com/crate-workbench/langchain/raw/cratedb/docs/docs/integrations/document_loaders/example_data/mlb_teams_2012.sql
crash < ./example_data/mlb_teams_2012.sql
crash --command "REFRESH TABLE mlb_teams_2012;"
```

### Load documents by SQL query
```python
from langchain.document_loaders import CrateDBLoader
from pprint import pprint

def main():
  loader = CrateDBLoader(
      'SELECT * FROM mlb_teams_2012 ORDER BY "Team" LIMIT 5;',
      url="crate://crate@localhost/",
  )
  documents = loader.load()
  pprint(documents)

if __name__ == "__main__":
  main()
```


## Usage » Conversational Memory

For a more detailed walkthrough of the `CrateDBChatMessageHistory`, there is also a corresponding
[Jupyter notebook](/docs/extras/integrations/memory/cratedb_chat_message_history.html).

```python
from langchain.memory.chat_message_histories import CrateDBChatMessageHistory
from pprint import pprint

def main():
  chat_message_history = CrateDBChatMessageHistory(
      session_id="test_session",
      connection_string="crate://crate@localhost/",
  )
  chat_message_history.add_user_message("Hello")
  chat_message_history.add_ai_message("Hi")
  pprint(chat_message_history)

if __name__ == "__main__":
  main()
```
