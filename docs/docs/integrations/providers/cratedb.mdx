# CrateDB

This documentation section shows how to use the CrateDB vector store
functionality around [`FLOAT_VECTOR`] and [`KNN_MATCH`]. You will learn
how to use it for similarity search and other purposes.


## What is CrateDB?

[CrateDB] is an open-source, distributed, and scalable SQL analytics database
for storing and analyzing massive amounts of data in near real-time, even with
complex queries. It is PostgreSQL-compatible, based on [Lucene], and inherits
the shared-nothing distribution layer of [Elasticsearch].

It provides a distributed, multi-tenant-capable relational database and search
engine with HTTP and PostgreSQL interfaces, and schema-free objects. It supports
sharding, partitioning, and replication out of the box.

CrateDB enables you to efficiently store billions of records, and terabytes of
data, and query it using SQL.

- Provides a standards-based SQL interface for querying relational data, nested
  documents, geospatial constraints, and vector embeddings at the same time.
- Improves your operations by storing time-series data, relational metadata,
  and vector embeddings within a single database.
- Builds upon approved technologies from Lucene and Elasticsearch.


## CrateDB Cloud

- Offers on-demand CrateDB clusters without operational overhead, 
  with enterprise-grade features and [ISO 27001] certification.
- The entrypoint to [CrateDB Cloud] is the [CrateDB Cloud Console].
- Crate.io offers a free tier via [CrateDB Cloud CRFREE].
- To get started, [sign up] to CrateDB Cloud, deploy a database cluster,
  and follow the upcoming instructions.


## Features

The CrateDB adapter supports the Vector Store subsystem of LangChain.

### Vector Store

`CrateDBVectorSearch` is an API wrapper around CrateDB's `FLOAT_VECTOR` type
and the corresponding `KNN_MATCH` function, based on SQLAlchemy and CrateDB's
SQLAlchemy dialect. It provides an interface to store and retrieve floating
point vectors, and to conduct similarity searches.

Supports:
- Approximate nearest neighbor search.
- Euclidean distance.


## Installation and Setup

There are multiple ways to get started with CrateDB.

### Install CrateDB on your local machine

You can [download CrateDB], or use the [OCI image] to run CrateDB on Docker or Podman.
Note that this is not recommended for production use.

```shell
docker run --rm -it --name=cratedb --publish=4200:4200 --publish=5432:5432 \
    --env=CRATE_HEAP_SIZE=4g crate/crate:nightly \
    -Cdiscovery.type=single-node
```

### Deploy a cluster on CrateDB Cloud

[CrateDB Cloud] is a managed CrateDB service. Sign up for a [free trial].

### Install Client

```bash
pip install 'crate[sqlalchemy]' 'langchain[openai]'
```


## Usage

For a more detailed walkthrough of the `CrateDBVectorSearch` wrapper, there is also
a corresponding [Jupyter notebook](/docs/extras/integrations/vectorstores/cratedb.html).

### Acquire text file
The example uses the canonical `state_of_the_union.txt`.
```shell
wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/langchain-ai/langchain/v0.0.291/docs/extras/modules/state_of_the_union.txt
```

### Set environment variables
Use a valid OpenAI API key and SQL connection string. This one fits a local instance of CrateDB.
```shell
export OPENAI_API_KEY=foobar  # FIXME
export CRATEDB_CONNECTION_STRING=crate://crate@localhost
```

```python
from langchain.document_loaders import TextLoader
from langchain.embeddings.openai import OpenAIEmbeddings
from langchain.text_splitter import CharacterTextSplitter
from langchain.vectorstores import CrateDBVectorSearch


def main():
  # Load the document, split it into chunks, embed each chunk and load it into the vector store.
  raw_documents = TextLoader("state_of_the_union.txt").load()
  text_splitter = CharacterTextSplitter(chunk_size=1000, chunk_overlap=0)
  documents = text_splitter.split_documents(raw_documents)
  db = CrateDBVectorSearch.from_documents(documents, OpenAIEmbeddings())

  query = "What did the president say about Ketanji Brown Jackson"
  docs = db.similarity_search(query)
  print(docs[0].page_content)


if __name__ == "__main__":
  main()
```
